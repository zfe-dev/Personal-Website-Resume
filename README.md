# Personal Website Resume

[See the result](https://resume.dubillaudb.fr/?lang=en)

## Home web page
All pages are in a different GIT repo to keep a clear architecture.

## Goal
As an IT student in engineering school, I aimed to create my own website to expose my resume and my projects.
It is my resume as a responsive web page. I made it simple and clear, but well designed so it's confortable to read.

## What I used
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/fr/intro-whatis.php) to build the asked page and choosing language.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) & [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) for responsive page avec some animations.
* Some tutorials which gave me ideas for the design (clearly not original).

## How to test it
As the page is build with differents PHP file, you may need an apache server. Otherwise, I let index.html file so you can try the design without any local server. index.html is only in repo and in local, but not on my server, which use index.php and built the page in the asked language (EN / FR).

### Do whatever you want with it
